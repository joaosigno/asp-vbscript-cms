#summary Coding standards and conventions for ASP-VBScript-CMS.

= Coding Standards =

Coding standards are Language-level standards, and to be honest, ASP VBScript doesnt have many.  The VBScript language itself is case-insensitive. Newlines are important, indentation is not, and there is only one form of comments.  We have to instate some code-level conventions to follow to improve code readability and sanity, which will be a major contributing factor to long-term maintainability. As this project is not under continual development, easy-to-read code will be of huge importance to be able to come back to pick up on after leaving the code sitting for years on end :)

*Options Explicit*

VBScript is a lazy language, its of extreme importance for code maintainability to force all variables to be declared before instantiation.


= Coding Conventions =


*Indentation*

Use tabs to indent your code. You should configure your code editor to set the tabstop to 4 spaces.

*Case*

VBScript is case-insensitive.  However, we generally try to keep all language-specific keywords in lowercase:

{{{
if [...] then
    'execute some code
end if
}}}

{{{
class Apple
    public function class_initialize()
        'initialize object
    end function
end class
}}}

*Whitespace*

Remove all trailing whitespace when saving your code.

Separate commands with a newline.  The one exception is for declaring variables.  Since we use `Options Explicit` it is possible to chain the definition and the variable assignment on a single line, using a *colon* to separate the two commands.

{{{
dim products : set products = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
}}}
