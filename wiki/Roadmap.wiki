#summary Planned improvements for the CMS.

= Introduction =

There are various aspects of the CMS that are incomplete, or where the implementation could be improved.


 * Improve global variable and token support. (PLANNED)
 * Code Cleanup:  instate coding standards, documentation, remove trailing whitespace, remove variant-type elements from variable names. remove 'tbl' prefixes from database tables.
 * Standardize and simplify module functionality.
 * Distinguish between modules and blocks.
 * Re-define 'module locations'  as 'block regions'.
 * Improve theming / templating support.
