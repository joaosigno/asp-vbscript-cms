#summary Planned improvements for the CMS.

= Introduction =

There are various aspects of the CMS that are incomplete, or where the implementation could be improved. Feel free to contribute ideas in the comments.

== Improvements ==

 * Improve global variable and token support.
 * Better error handling and messaging.
 * Standardize and improve ModuleAPI (currently only one hook: getContents() )
 * Distinguish between modules and blocks.
 * Re-define 'module locations'  as 'block regions'.
 * Improve template system and add multiple/customized theme support.
 * Move database schema to code, allowing for easy installation, migrations, and updates.
 * Support for installation and upgrade scripts to build the database from code-based schema info in the code.

== General and ongoing code cleanup ==
 * Instate and follow [CodeConventions]
 * Improve code readability.
 * Improve code / comment ratio.
 * Remove trailing whitespace.
 * Remove variant-type elements from variable names. (eg strProductName --> product_name)
 * Remove 'tbl' prefixes from database tables.
